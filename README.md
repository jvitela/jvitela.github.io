## Recompute
An alternative *selector* library for Redux inspired by Reselect and Computed properties from MobX, Aurelia and Angular. 

Unlike Reselect, Recompute selectors can:
- be shared across multiple component instances
- take any number of arguments
- have unbounded cache size
- directly invoke other selectors

## jvCalendar
A dependency free javascript library for creating calendars. 
Unlike normal calendar plugins, this just provides the business logic to 
generate the calendar data. 
Library consumers are responsible for providing the UI layer.

This is not ment to be an out-of-the-box solution, instead the goal is to provide a solid fundation for building calendar widgets.
